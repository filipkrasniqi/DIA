Imagine an average daily budget/clicks curve (providing, for every value of daily budget, the number of daily clicks) aggregating the curves of three different classes of users. Notice that, in order to define the curves, it is necessary the definition of probability distributions. Provide a description of the three classes of users. Note: the definition of the classes of the users must be done by introducing features and different values for the features (e.g., gender, interests, age)."

And, if such an algorithm suggests disaggregating the curve at time t, then, from t on, keep such curves disaggregate. In order to disaggregate the curve, it is necessary to reason on the features and the values of the features. Apply the Combinatorial-GP-TS algorithm and show, in a plot, how the regret and the reward vary in time (also comparing the regret and the reward of these algorithms with those obtained when the algorithms are applied to the aggregate curve)."
